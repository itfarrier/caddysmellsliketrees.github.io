      This is an example of fluid type that maintains vertical rhythm. I'll try
      and find the time to write it up in detail soon.

    <p>
      If the lines seem to glitch out ocasionally it's not because the vertical
      rhythm is broken. I think it's because of the way the browser rounds. The
      height of the gradient background that draws the lines on the body element
      is only rounded once, whereas real line hight is rounded on a per element
      basis. This adds up by the time you get to the bottom of the page. No idea
      how to fix it!
